# ML_validation

The project is about social media ads, project had done by using SVM algorithm in order to measure validation score, accuracy.

Step by step process:

1. Importing the libraries
2. Importing the dataset
3. Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
4. Feature Scaling
5. Fitting Kernel SVM to the Training set
6. Predicting the Test set results
7. Making the Confusion Matrix
8. Applying k-Fold Cross Validation
9. Applying Grid Search to find the best model and the best parameters
10. Visualising the Training set results
11. Visualising the Test set results
